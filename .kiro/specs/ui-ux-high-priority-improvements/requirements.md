# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical UI/UX improvements identified in the family chore calendar application. These high-priority improvements focus on immediate usability issues that significantly impact user experience, particularly around missing functionality, mobile responsiveness, user feedback, and loading states.

The improvements will enhance user satisfaction, reduce confusion, and make the application more accessible across all devices while maintaining the existing functionality and data integrity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Edit and Delete Functionality for Recurring Chores

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the recurring chores list THEN I SHALL see edit and delete buttons on each chore card
2. WHEN I click the edit button THEN the system SHALL open a pre-populated form with the current chore details
3. WHEN I modify recurring chore details and save THEN the system SHALL update the chore template and show a success message
4. WHEN I click the delete button THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog with impact details
5. WHEN I confirm deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the recurring chore and show confirmation
6. IF a recurring chore has generated instances THEN the system SHALL warn about impact on existing assignments
7. WHEN editing recurrence patterns THEN the system SHALL validate the new pattern and show preview of next occurrences
8. IF I cancel editing THEN the system SHALL discard changes and return to the list view

### Requirement 2: Mobile-Optimized Modal Design

**User Story:** As a family member using a mobile device, I want modals to display properly on my screen so that I can easily interact with forms and content without horizontal scrolling or cut-off elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open any modal on a mobile device THEN it SHALL fit within the viewport without horizontal scrolling
2. WHEN viewing modals on screens smaller than 768px THEN they SHALL use responsive sizing (max-w-sm or similar)
3. WHEN modal content exceeds screen height THEN it SHALL scroll vertically within the modal container
4. WHEN I interact with form elements in modals THEN they SHALL be appropriately sized for touch input
5. WHEN keyboard appears on mobile THEN the modal SHALL adjust to remain accessible
6. WHEN I tap outside a modal THEN it SHALL close (unless it contains unsaved changes)
7. IF a modal contains unsaved changes THEN the system SHALL warn before closing
8. WHEN modal opens THEN it SHALL focus on the first interactive element for accessibility

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Message Display and Feedback

**User Story:** As a family member, I want clear and persistent feedback messages so that I understand the results of my actions and can take appropriate next steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system shows a success message THEN it SHALL remain visible for at least 7 seconds
2. WHEN the system shows an error message THEN it SHALL remain visible for at least 10 seconds
3. WHEN any message is displayed THEN it SHALL include a dismiss button for manual closure
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the message SHALL include specific guidance on how to resolve the issue
5. WHEN a success action completes THEN the message SHALL suggest logical next steps when applicable
6. WHEN multiple messages would appear THEN the system SHALL queue them or combine related messages
7. IF an action affects other family members THEN the message SHALL indicate the scope of impact
8. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry options and offline guidance

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Loading States

**User Story:** As a family member, I want to see clear loading indicators for all actions so that I know the system is working and understand when actions are complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform any async action THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate loading indicator
2. WHEN loading data for the first time THEN the system SHALL show skeleton screens matching the expected content layout
3. WHEN submitting forms THEN buttons SHALL show loading state and be disabled to prevent double-submission
4. WHEN performing chore operations (complete, assign, delete) THEN the specific item SHALL show loading state
5. WHEN navigating between calendar weeks THEN the system SHALL show loading state during data fetch
6. WHEN generating recurring chores THEN the system SHALL show progress indication for long operations
7. IF loading takes longer than 3 seconds THEN the system SHALL show additional context or progress details
8. WHEN loading fails THEN the system SHALL show error state with retry options

### Requirement 5: Form Validation and User Guidance

**User Story:** As a family member filling out forms, I want immediate feedback on my input so that I can correct errors before submission and understand what information is required.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I interact with form fields THEN the system SHALL show real-time validation feedback
2. WHEN a field has an error THEN it SHALL display specific guidance on how to fix it
3. WHEN required fields are empty THEN they SHALL be clearly marked and explained
4. WHEN I enter invalid data THEN the system SHALL explain what format is expected
5. WHEN form submission fails THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic fields and maintain user input
6. WHEN I start typing in an error field THEN the error message SHALL clear once input becomes valid
7. IF a form has multiple steps THEN the system SHALL show progress and allow navigation between completed steps
8. WHEN I navigate away from unsaved forms THEN the system SHALL warn about losing changes

### Requirement 6: Improved Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a family member, I want helpful error messages and recovery options so that I can resolve issues independently and continue using the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL distinguish between temporary and persistent issues
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages rather than generic failures
3. WHEN authentication expires THEN the system SHALL guide users through re-authentication
4. WHEN data conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL explain the conflict and provide resolution options
5. WHEN permissions are insufficient THEN the system SHALL explain required permissions and how to obtain them
6. WHEN validation fails THEN error messages SHALL be actionable and specific to the field or operation
7. IF errors are recoverable THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
8. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain application stability and offer graceful degradation

### Requirement 7: Touch-Friendly Interface Elements

**User Story:** As a family member using touch devices, I want interface elements that are easy to tap accurately so that I can efficiently interact with the application without frustration.

#### Acceptance Criteria
