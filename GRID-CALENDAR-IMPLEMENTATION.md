  <RegularCalendar />
)}

// Header: Days of week
<div className="grid grid-cols-8 gap-2">
  <div>Family Member</div>
  {weekDates.map(date => <DayHeader />)}
</div>

// Rows: Each family member
{familyMembers.map(member => (
  <div className="grid grid-cols-8 gap-2">
    <MemberInfo />
    {weekDates.map(date => (
      <DropZone member={member} date={date} />
