### **âœ… Solution:**
- **Regular users** now only see **their own chores**
- **Admins** still see **everyone's chores** (for management)

## ðŸŽ¯ **What Changed:**

### **ðŸ“… Calendar View:**
- **Regular Users:** Only see their own chore assignments

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation:**

### **Assignment Filtering:**
```typescript
// Filter assignments based on user role
let filteredAssignments = assignments.filter(assignment => 
  assignment.date.split('T')[0] === dateStr
);

// For non-admins, only show their own chores
if (!currentUser.isAdmin) {
  filteredAssignments = filteredAssignments.filter(assignment => 
    assignment.user.id === currentUser.id
  );
}
```

### **Summary Statistics:**
```typescript
// Role-based statistics
const relevantAssignments = currentUser.isAdmin 
  ? assignments  // All assignments for admins
  : assignments.filter(a => a.user.id === currentUser.id);  // Own assignments for users
```

### **UI Personalization:**
```typescript
// Personalized headers and labels
<h2>
  {currentUser.isAdmin ? 'ðŸ“… Family Chore Calendar' : 'ðŸ“… Your Chore Calendar'}
</h2>

<div className="text-sm text-blue-600">
  {currentUser.isAdmin ? 'Total Chores' : 'Your Chores'}
