## 🚀 Implementation Details

### Automatic Point Awards
Points are automatically awarded when chores are completed through the existing assignment system:

```typescript
// In /api/assignments/[id]/route.ts
if (completed && !assignment.completed) {
  // Award points
  await prisma.pointsEarned.create({
    data: {
      userId: user.id,
      familyId: user.familyId!,
      choreId: assignment.choreId,
      points: assignment.chore.points,
      date: new Date(),
      weekStart
    }
  })

  // Update user's total points
  await prisma.user.update({
    where: { id: user.id },
    data: {
      totalPoints: {
        increment: assignment.chore.points
      }
    }
  })
}
```

### Point Calculation Logic
- **Weekly Start**: Calculated as Sunday 00:00:00 of each week
- **Monthly Aggregation**: Sum of all weekly totals in a month
- **Ranking**: Based on `totalPoints` field, updated in real-time
- **Goal Progress**: Percentage of weekly points vs. weekly goal
